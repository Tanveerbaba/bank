# Curl-script contains three endpoints:

1. login endpoint to generate jwt token -- Need to pass username and password in requestbody.

 # Endpoint -
      https://fyle-bank-16092019.herokuapp.com/login
      {
"username" : "user"
"password" - "password"
}

2. This endpoint fetches the branch based on ifsc code. Used offset and limit as per the requirement but was not necessary because only branch object will be returned.

# Endpoint - 
    https://fyle-bank-16092019.herokuapp.com/fyle/bank/bankDetails?ifsc=<>&offset=<>&limit=<>
    
3. This endpoint fetches all the branches based on bank name and city. Here offset and limit plays an important role to fetch the limitted number of objects using pagination.

# Endpoint - 
    https://fyle-bank-16092019.herokuapp.com/fyle/bank/branches?bank_name=<>&city=<>&offset=<>&limit=<>
    
 # Jwt token generated by login endpoint must be added in the header of last two endpoints. Using Authorization header.
